clone fighter made the textbox library, camspatience modified it to support
portraits in the style of srb2 textboxes

this addon can be loaded on top of srb2 the past, and replaces several maps:
- map01 (the museum)
- map31 (metal's challenge)
- mapnz (nights hub)
- mapuz (unlockables hub)
- mapyz (dev hub)
- mapez (erz hub)
- mapz1-z3 (cutscenes)

there are some changes made to dialogue for one of three reasons:
- grammar/spelling
- shifting things around to fit in textboxes proper
- factual corrections (literally only once, iirc.)

feel free to revert any changes you wind up disliking them

also i filled in some cyan pixels on toad's portrait since i didn't feel like
figuring out how to parse cyan pixels in lua. having a transparent color in
the palette kinda sucks anyway ngl

to-do:
- idk is there anything left? bugfixing if anything arises i suppose

if any issues arise please let me know! if you've downloaded this file,
you know where to find me lol.
